# Inkscape shortcut manager

*A shortcut manager that speeds up drawing (mathematical) figures in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).*
This is a fork of the marvelous project of [Gilles Castel](https://castel.dev/) for a set of better shortcuts for drawing figures during class lectures.
[Here](https://github.com/gillescastel/inkscape-figures) the link to the original branch.
